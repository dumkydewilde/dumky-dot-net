For a lot of the posts you'll read on this site, the implementation will actually be tested on this site as well. 
Since you are reading this and thus are participating in my grand web analytics experiment (thank you!), it's only fair that you
get to see the results as well. Below you can find most of the data collected on dumky.net. I try to only collect page
data as that is what is relevant to me (i.e. top posts and referring pages).

## Pageviews
{{% analytics 100 220 "pageviews" %}}

## Top Referrers
_Last 90 Days_
{{% analytics 75 350 "referrers" %}}

## Top 10 posts
_Last 90 Days_
{{% analytics 75 450 "topPosts" %}}
